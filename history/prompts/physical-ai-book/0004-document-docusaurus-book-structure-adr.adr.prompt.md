Created an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) titled "Docusaurus Book Structure". The ADR documents the decision to use a directory-based, autogenerated sidebar structure for book content in Docusaurus, detailing the context, consequences, and alternatives considered.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The agent successfully documented a key architectural decision, ensuring future alignment and understanding of the chosen content structure.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Created `history/adr/0001-docusaurus-book-structure.adr.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with implementing the tasks defined in `specs/physical-ai-book/tasks.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: Capturing this decision in an ADR is important for long-term project maintainability. It was correctly identified as an architecturally significant decision during the planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of the tasks in `tasks.md`.
