# Implementation Plan: Physical AI Book

**Branch**: `feat/physical-ai-book-structure` | **Date**: 2025-12-09 | **Spec**: [specs/physical-ai-book/spec.md](specs/physical-ai-book/spec.md)
**Input**: User request to create a development plan for the Docusaurus book.

## Summary

This plan outlines the steps to implement the "Physical AI Book" feature within the existing Docusaurus project. The goal is to establish the necessary file structure, configure the navigation, and provide a phased approach for developing the initial content as defined in the feature specification.

## Technical Context

*   **Language/Version**: JavaScript (Node.js for Docusaurus)
*   **Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React
*   **Storage**: Markdown files (`.md`/`.mdx`)
*   **Testing**: Docusaurus build process, manual navigation testing
*   **Target Platform**: Web (via Docusaurus)
*   **Project Type**: Documentation / Static Site
*   **Constraints**: Must integrate with the existing Docusaurus structure without breaking it.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Docusaurus Scaffolding & Setup

This phase focuses on creating the foundational structure for the book within the Docusaurus site.

*   **Step 1.1: Create Directories**: Create the directory `docs/physical-ai-book` to house all book-related content.
*   **Step 1.2: Configure Sidebar Label**: Create a `_category_.json` file inside `docs/physical-ai-book` to provide a clean, user-friendly label for the sidebar entry.
*   **Step 1.3: Update Navigation**: Modify the `sidebars.js` file to add a new category that automatically generates a sidebar menu from the contents of the `docs/physical-ai-book` directory.
*   **Step 1.4: Scaffold Content Files**: Create empty placeholder markdown files for the first chapter and its three lessons. This ensures the sidebar links are functional for testing.

### Phase 2: Initial Content Development

This phase involves writing the first draft of the lessons based on the content guidelines in the specification.

*   **Step 2.1: Write Lesson 1**: Populate `lesson1-bits-to-atoms.md` with a full draft, including Objective, Core Concepts, Practical Example, Test Your Understanding, and Key Takeaways.
*   **Step 2.2: Write Lesson 2**: Populate `lesson2-sensors-and-perception.md` with a full draft.
*   **Step 2.3: Write Lesson 3**: Populate `lesson3-actuators-and-action.md` with a full draft.

### Phase 3: Review and Refinement

This phase is for polishing the content to ensure quality and clarity.

*   **Step 3.1: Technical and Editorial Review**: Proofread all lessons for technical accuracy, grammar, spelling, and adherence to the project's tone of voice.
*   **Step 3.2: Add Visuals**: Enhance the lessons by adding relevant images, diagrams, or creating interactive MDX components where applicable.
*   **Step 3.3: Final Build Verification**: Run the Docusaurus build process to ensure no errors were introduced and that all content renders correctly.

## Proposed File Structure

The following structure will be used for the book's content, located in the project's `docs` directory.

```text
docs/
└── physical-ai-book/
    ├── _category_.json
    ├── chapter1.md
    ├── lesson1-bits-to-atoms.md
    ├── lesson2-sensors-and-perception.md
    └── lesson3-actuators-and-action.md
```

**Structure Decision**: This structure was chosen for its simplicity and direct compatibility with Docusaurus's `autogenerated` sidebar feature. It keeps all related book content organized in a single, dedicated directory, making it easy to manage and scale.
