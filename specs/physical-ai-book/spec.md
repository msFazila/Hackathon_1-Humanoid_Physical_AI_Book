# Feature Specification: Physical AI Book Structure

**Feature Branch**: `feat/physical-ai-book-structure`
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Based on the constitution, create a detailed specification for a physical AI book including: 1. Book structure with 1 chapter and 3 lessons each (title and descriptions) 2. Content guidelines and lesson format 3. Docusaurus specific : requirements for organisation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Reader Accesses New Book Chapter (Priority: P1)

As a new reader, I want to easily find and navigate the "Physical AI Book" section on the website, so I can start learning from the first chapter and its lessons.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary entry point for any user wanting to engage with the new book content. If the structure is not in place, the content is inaccessible.

**Independent Test**: The "Physical AI Book" chapter and its three lessons are visible in the sidebar navigation. Clicking on each link successfully navigates to the correct content page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a user is on the website, **When** they look at the sidebar navigation, **Then** they should see a collapsible category named "The Embodied Mind".
2.  **Given** the "The Embodied Mind" category is visible, **When** the user expands it, **Then** they should see three links for "Lesson 1: From Bits to Atoms," "Lesson 2: Sensors and Perception," and "Lesson 3: Actuators and Action."
3.  **Given** the lessons are visible in the sidebar, **When** a user clicks on any lesson link, **Then** they are taken to the corresponding markdown page for that lesson.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Book Structure

- **BS-001**: A new top-level directory named `physical-ai-book` will be created inside the `/docs` directory.
- **BS-002**: The book will have one main chapter for now.
    - **Chapter 1: The Embodied Mind**
        - **Description**: This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI, exploring how intelligence moves from the digital realm to interact with the physical world.
        - **Lessons**:
            1.  **Lesson 1: From Bits to Atoms**
                - **Description**: An introduction to the core idea of Physical AI. It differentiates between purely software-based AI and embodied agents that can perceive and act in the real world.
            2.  **Lesson 2: Sensors and Perception**
                - **Description**: This lesson covers the various sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar, tactile sensors) that allow AI to gather information about its physical environment.
            3.  **Lesson 3: Actuators and Action**
                - **Description**: This lesson explains how AI translates decisions into physical actions using actuators like motors, grippers, and other mechanical systems.

### Content Guidelines & Lesson Format

- **CG-001**: Every lesson's markdown file MUST follow a consistent format:
    - **Objective**: A one-sentence summary of what the reader will learn.
    - **Core Concepts**: A section explaining the main theoretical points.
    - **Practical Example**: A hands-on tutorial or case study that illustrates the concepts.
    - **Test Your Understanding**: A small section with 2-3 questions or a simple exercise to reinforce learning.
    - **Key Takeaways**: A bulleted list summarizing the most important points.
- **CG-002**: The tone MUST be encouraging and align with the "Audience-Centric" principle from the constitution.
- **CG-003**: All code examples MUST be complete, runnable, and well-commented.

### Docusaurus Specific Requirements

- **DR-001**: A new file `_category_.json` MUST be created within `/docs/physical-ai-book` to label the sidebar entry. It should contain:
    ```json
    {
      "label": "The Embodied Mind",
      "position": 3
    }
    ```
- **DR-002**: The `sidebars.js` file MUST be updated to include the new book structure. A new entry should be added to the `docSidebar` array:
    ```js
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'The Embodied Mind',
      items: [
        {
          type: 'autogenerated',
          dirName: 'physical-ai-book',
        },
      ],
    },
    ```
- **DR-003**: Placeholder markdown files for the chapter and three lessons MUST be created in the `/docs/physical-ai-book/` directory.
    - `chapter1.md` (or an `index.md` for the chapter overview)
    - `lesson1-bits-to-atoms.md`
    - `lesson2-sensors-and-perception.md`
    - `lesson3-actuators-and-action.md`

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

- **SC-001**: A new "The Embodied Mind" section is present and correctly ordered in the documentation sidebar.
- **SC-002**: All three lessons are listed under the chapter and clicking them navigates to their respective (initially placeholder) pages without error.
- **SC-003**: The file structure in the `docs` directory matches the specification.
- **SC-004**: The changes do not break the existing Docusaurus build process.
