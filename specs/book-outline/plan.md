# Plan: Physical-AI Book

## 1. Target Audience

Beginner to Intermediate learners with an interest in AI, robotics, and hardware. No prior experience with embedded systems is assumed, but basic programming knowledge (Python) is helpful.

## 2. Core Principles (from Constitution)

*   **Audience-Centric:** Keep it simple, explain jargon.
*   **Hands-On Learning:** Every chapter includes a practical project.
*   **Docusaurus for Documentation:** Web-first, interactive content.
