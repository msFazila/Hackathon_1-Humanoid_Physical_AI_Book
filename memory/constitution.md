# Physical-AI Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Audience-Centric
Content is crafted for a beginner-to-intermediate audience. All concepts must be explained clearly, avoiding jargon where possible, or defining it thoroughly when necessary. The learning curve should be gradual and supportive.

### II. Hands-On Learning
The primary focus is on practical application. Every theoretical concept must be paired with clear, concise, and well-documented hands-on tutorials and projects. The goal is for readers to learn by doing.

### III. Docusaurus for Documentation
We will use Docusaurus as the core technology for structuring and presenting the book. We will leverage its features (like MDX, versioning, and search) to create an interactive, accessible, and well-organized learning experience.

### IV. Code Quality and Clarity
All code examples must be clean, well-commented, and follow consistent style guidelines. The purpose of the code should be immediately understandable to the target audience.

### V. Modularity and Structure
The book will be organized into logical, self-contained modules or chapters. This allows readers to either follow a linear path or jump to topics of interest. The structure should be clear and easy to navigate via the Docusaurus sidebar.
